Project Description:
    For our project, we decided to create a personal financing app or website that will help users save their money
    in the most sophisticated and ideal way.

Problem Statement: Write a paragraph explaining the motivation behind choosing the project-
    We chose to create a personal financing application or website that will use the users information that is inputted
    to provide suggestions to that user about how they can save money. We thought this was a good project to do because
    we all have interests in saving money, and we felt like this was the most user helpful idea that we had.

List of users: Who will be using your system-
    Any customer/user that has access to a phone or computer AND has an email account of any kind can make an account. There are 
    no payment requirements or other requirements.
    We expect our typical client to be a person between the ages of 16-90. Although the system can be used by anyone, it will
    probably only be used by the people in this age range because they are the ones who will be making or spending money on a
    regular basis.

List of functionalities provided for each user: What are the features provided for each user to use?-
    Each user will be able to:
        - Have a running total of their money
        - Keep track on transactions (deposits, withdrawals, expenses)
        - Monthly profit/loss analysis
        - Advice of how to save money

List of potential technologies being used: Like technology for database, language(s) of implementation etc.-
